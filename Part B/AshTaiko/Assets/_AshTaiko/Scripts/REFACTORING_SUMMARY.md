# ChartDatabase.cs Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original `ChartDatabase.cs` file contained multiple classes and enums in a single file, making it difficult to maintain and navigate. This refactoring splits the file into logical, focused components for better code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Structure
- **Original**: Single `ChartDatabase.cs` file (566 lines)
- **New**: 5 separate files with focused responsibilities

### 2. New File Organization

#### `SongEntry.cs` (184 lines)
- Contains the `SongEntry` class
- Handles song metadata and chart management
- Includes image path resolution logic
- Provides debugging utilities for image paths

#### `ChartData.cs` (32 lines)
- Contains the `ChartData` class
- Manages chart-specific data (difficulty, timing, hit objects)
- Includes chart metadata like HP, circle size, star rating

#### `TimingPoint.cs` (20 lines)
- Contains the `TimingPoint` class
- Handles rhythm and timing information
- Includes computed BPM property

#### `Enums.cs` (20 lines)
- Contains `Difficulty` enum (Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Expert, Master)
- Contains `SongFormat` enum (Unknown, Osu, Tja)

#### `ChartDatabase.cs` (332 lines)
- Contains only the `ChartDatabase` MonoBehaviour class
- Focuses on database management and song scanning
- Handles file import operations (osu!, TJA)
- Manages song merging and database operations

### 3. Benefits of Refactoring

#### Maintainability
- Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

#### Code Organization
- Logical separation of concerns
- Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
- Improved code readability and navigation

#### Collaboration
- Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
- Reduced merge conflicts when modifying different classes
- Clearer ownership of different parts of the system

#### Testing
- Individual classes can be tested in isolation
- Easier to create focused unit tests
- Better test organization and maintenance

### 4. Dependencies Maintained
All existing dependencies and references have been preserved:
- `SongDatabase` class references remain intact
- `OsuImporter` and `TjaImporter` dependencies preserved
- `HitObject` class references maintained
- All method signatures and public interfaces unchanged

### 5. File Locations
All new files are located in the same directory:
```
Assets/_AshTaiko/Scripts/
├── ChartDatabase.cs      (refactored)
├── SongEntry.cs          (new)
├── ChartData.cs          (new)
├── TimingPoint.cs        (new)
└── Enums.cs              (new)
```

### 6. Compilation
The refactoring maintains full compatibility:
- No breaking changes to existing code
- All Unity serialization attributes preserved
- Namespace structure maintained
- Existing prefabs and scenes will continue to work

## Migration Notes
- No manual changes required in existing code
- Unity will automatically recompile the new file structure
- Existing serialized data will be preserved
- All functionality remains identical from an external perspective

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding XML documentation to public methods
- Evaluate if additional classes could benefit from interfaces
- Monitor compilation times with the new file structure
- Consider grouping related files into subdirectories if the project grows
